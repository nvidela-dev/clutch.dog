### Development Approach

- First PRs will establish the foundational coding editor
- Initial focus on getting a working React exercise with functioning tests
- **Pivot to Express exercises first** for the MVP, as they only involve tests and will be easier to implement
- React exercises will be developed after Express exercises are complete

### Coding Editor Requirements

- Syntax highlighting functionality similar to Visual Studio Code
- **Integrated console** that runs alongside the editor
- Test execution capability that runs tests against the code in the editor
- Pass/fail feedback system to indicate whether tests are passing

### Exercise Implementation Order

1. Express exercises (MVP priority - test-only exercises)
2. React exercises (post-MVP)
